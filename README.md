# Live-Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Tensorflow

The project has been made for the CA as part of the curriculum 
for the subject INT247: Machine Learning Foundation from the course B. Tech (Hons.) Computer Science Engineering with minor in Machine Learning.

The main idea for the project has come from the growing possibilities in Image detection in Machine learning and Neural Networks, 
many fields are using this technology and from that view, got an idea about sign language detection for deaf and dumb people 
this will be very helpful for those type of people. We started training images as per the universal sign language 
and those trained images will get detect the sign languages and the remaining process.

Modules/Libraries Used : OS, NumPy Matplotlib, Open-CV, Time
